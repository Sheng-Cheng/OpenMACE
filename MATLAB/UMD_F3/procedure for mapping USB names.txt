Procedure for assigning fixed USB ports. (Sheng Cheng, cheng@terpmail.umd.edu, Nov., 2020)

0. LAZY method: run the following command in your MACE_F3 directory and skip steps 1-5:

$ sudo ./USBmapping.sh

The following procedure shows you how to assign USB mappings step-by-step.

1. Use the following command to write the file for mapping USB names:

$ sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/10-usb-serial.rules

2. Look up properties of the USB device you want to map by examing the following command:

$ udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk

From this command, you shall see the properties of several devices. 
Usually you can tell which device is the target device by reading through all the properties.
Take a note of the following properties: ATTRS{idVendor}, ATTRS{idProduct}, ATTRS{serial}.

3. Go to the file opened in step 1 and write the information obtained in step 2. 

The following line shows an example: idVendor, idProduct, and serial are all from step 2; The desired name for this device is ttyUSB_U2S.
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", ATTRS{serial}=="A9080BN0",  SYMLINK+="ttyUSB_U2S"

4. Use the following command to make the mapping take effect:

$ sudo udevadm trigger

5. Check whether the mapping is working by examing the following command:
$ ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*


Memo:
1. The following names are used for drone 1- 6:

ttyUSB_drone1
ttyUSB_drone2
ttyUSB_drone3
ttyUSB_drone4
ttyUSB_drone5
ttyUSB_drone6
