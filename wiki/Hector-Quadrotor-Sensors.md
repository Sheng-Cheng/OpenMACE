Below is a rundown of the available sensors for Hector Quadrotor and their message definitions. The ROS message type is also specified. 

## Laser Scan
_When using a Hokuyo laser_
**ROS Message Type:** `sensor_msgs::LaserScan`

**Message Definition:**
```
# Single scan from a planar laser range-finder
Header header            # timestamp in the header is the acquisition time of 
                         # the first ray in the scan.
                         #
                         # in frame frame_id, angles are measured around 
                         # the positive Z axis (counterclockwise, if Z is up)
                         # with zero angle being forward along the x axis
                         
float32 angle_min        # start angle of the scan [rad]
float32 angle_max        # end angle of the scan [rad]
float32 angle_increment  # angular distance between measurements [rad]

float32 time_increment   # time between measurements [seconds] - if your scanner
                         # is moving, this will be used in interpolating position
                         # of 3d points
float32 scan_time        # time between scans [seconds]

float32 range_min        # minimum range value [m]
float32 range_max        # maximum range value [m]

float32[] ranges         # range data [m] (Note: values < range_min or > range_max should be discarded)
float32[] intensities    # intensity data [device-specific units].  If your
                         # device does not provide intensities, please leave
                         # the array empty.
```

## Occupancy Grid
**ROS Message Type:** `nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid`

**Message Definition:**
```
# This represents a 2-D grid map, in which each cell represents the probability of
# occupancy.

Header header 

# MetaData for the map
MapMetaData info

# The map data, in row-major order, starting with (0,0).  Occupancy
# probabilities are in the range [0,100].  Unknown is -1.
int8[] data
```

## Kinect
### Depth (image)
**ROS Message Type:** `sensor_msgs::Image`

**Message Definition:**
```
# This message contains an uncompressed image
# (0, 0) is at top-left corner of image
#

Header header        # Header timestamp should be acquisition time of image
                     # Header frame_id should be optical frame of camera
                     # origin of frame should be optical center of cameara
                     # +x should point to the right in the image
                     # +y should point down in the image
                     # +z should point into to plane of the image
                     # If the frame_id here and the frame_id of the CameraInfo
                     # message associated with the image conflict
                     # the behavior is undefined

uint32 height         # image height, that is, number of rows
uint32 width          # image width, that is, number of columns

# The legal values for encoding are in file src/image_encodings.cpp
# If you want to standardize a new string format, join
# ros-users@lists.sourceforge.net and send an email proposing a new encoding.

string encoding       # Encoding of pixels -- channel meaning, ordering, size
                      # taken from the list of strings in include/sensor_msgs/image_encodings.h

uint8 is_bigendian    # is this data bigendian?
uint32 step           # Full row length in bytes
uint8[] data          # actual matrix data, size is (step * rows)
```

### Depth (points)
**ROS Message Type:** `sensor_msgs::PointCloud2`

**Message Definition:**
```
# This message holds a collection of N-dimensional points, which may
# contain additional information such as normals, intensity, etc. The
# point data is stored as a binary blob, its layout described by the
# contents of the "fields" array.

# The point cloud data may be organized 2d (image-like) or 1d
# (unordered). Point clouds organized as 2d images may be produced by
# camera depth sensors such as stereo or time-of-flight.

# Time of sensor data acquisition, and the coordinate frame ID (for 3d
# points).
Header header

# 2D structure of the point cloud. If the cloud is unordered, height is
# 1 and width is the length of the point cloud.
uint32 height
uint32 width

# Describes the channels and their layout in the binary data blob.
PointField[] fields

bool    is_bigendian # Is this data bigendian?
uint32  point_step   # Length of a point in bytes
uint32  row_step     # Length of a row in bytes
uint8[] data         # Actual point data, size is (row_step*height)

bool is_dense        # True if there are no invalid points
```

### Image (RGB)
**ROS Message Type:** `sensor_msgs::Image`

**Message Definition:**
```
# This message contains an uncompressed image
# (0, 0) is at top-left corner of image
#

Header header        # Header timestamp should be acquisition time of image
                     # Header frame_id should be optical frame of camera
                     # origin of frame should be optical center of cameara
                     # +x should point to the right in the image
                     # +y should point down in the image
                     # +z should point into to plane of the image
                     # If the frame_id here and the frame_id of the CameraInfo
                     # message associated with the image conflict
                     # the behavior is undefined

uint32 height         # image height, that is, number of rows
